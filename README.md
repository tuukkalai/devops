# DevOps with Docker

Repository for [DevOps with Docker](https://devopswithdocker.com) course.

## Aliases

Some answers in this repo might start with command `d` or `d-c`.

These are aliases for `docker` and `docker-compose` in my current system.

```sh
alias d='docker $*'
alias d-c='docker-compose $*'
```

## Material applications

Some of the assignments rely on applications provided in material. Pull latest
apps to project root with

```sh
git clone https://github.com/docker-hy/material-applications.git
```
