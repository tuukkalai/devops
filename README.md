# DevOps with Docker

Repository for [DevOps with Docker](https://devopswithdocker.com) course.

## Aliases

Some answers in this repo might start with command `d` or `d-c`.

These are aliases for `docker` and `docker-compose` in my current system.

```sh
alias d='docker $*'
alias d-c='docker-compose $*'
```
