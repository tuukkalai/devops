> React starting app with Typescript

## What's done as part of devopswithdocker.com assignment

I set a fresh copy of create-react-app's Typescript template and dockerized it.

Running the following commands produce a development environment for React Typescript app.

```sh
> docker-compose up
```

After first run and after first edits to App.tsx file I received an mysterious error. Running `docker-compose up --build` resolved the error.
