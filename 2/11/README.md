## What's done as part of devopswithdocker.com assignment

Dockerized create-react-app's Typescript template. Fairly raw, not an full application yet, but starting point to development for dockerized React app.

Running the following commands produce a development environment for React Typescript app.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tuukkalai/ts-dev-env.git front
docker-compose up
```
